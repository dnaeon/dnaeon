Hey there! 

I'm @dnaeon and I work on various open source projects in Python, Go,
Common Lisp or anything else that I'm currently interested in.

I also maintain a [blog](http://dnaeon.github.io/) where I write about
the things I'm currently working on, and where you can find guides on
various topics like virtualization, programming, operating systems, or
anything else that comes to my mind.
